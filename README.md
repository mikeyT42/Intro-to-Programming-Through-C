# Introduction To Programming Through C

This is the course I have made for an introduction into programming through the useage of the "C" programming language.
All of the course material for the class is kept in this repo. At the end, the student will receive the link to this
repository. If you are a student seeing this repository then CONGRATULATIONS! You have gotten through the entire course
material successfully; you should be proud of yourself.

I simply use this repository to safely store the materials.
